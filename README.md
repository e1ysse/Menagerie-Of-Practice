# Menagerie-Of-Practice

This is where I will be demonstrating my commitment to practice, as well as having a place to store all the mini projects I've been working on. 
While definitely not organized at the moment, the idea of the directory is as follows:
  1. the main branch is completely blank (its a template to easily start off on)
  2. all the other branches are their own project

I am using React JS, with Vite.
